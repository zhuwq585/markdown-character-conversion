# markdown-character-conversion README

## Features

When writing Japanese notes in markdown,
it is too inconvenient that we need to switch the input language frequently.
That is because markdown syntax can not support the necessary characters like # in full-width characters "ï¼ƒ". (Yes, they are different symbols.)

This extension converts the markdown syntax-related characters from full-width to half-width,
to reduce the switch of the input language.
When the cursor moves to another line,
the conversion will be applied to the previous line.
